      IDD-CDT Creative and Innovative Camp was a 5-day game development camp for high school students hosted by Thammasat University. I was in a team of five as the only programmer. 
      <br><br>
      We decided to create an asymmetric two-player co-op game, in which one player played as a mage with a powerful spell to clear enemies in a big radius, however, after casting the spell, the mage will be left vulnerable for a while. This is when another player, the knight, comes in. The knight can attack enemies in short-range but requires a shorter cooldown period, which allows them to protect the mage until the spell is ready once again.
      <br><br>
      In the end, our teamâ€™s project was chosen by the judges to go in the first place, thanks to our unique idea, amazing art, and stunning presentation.
